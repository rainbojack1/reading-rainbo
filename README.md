  5. Express

  6. Mongoose

  7. DotEnv

  8. Concurrently

## Instructions

* This application requires at minimum 2 pages, check out the following mockup images for each page:

  * [Search](Search.png) - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

  * [Saved](Saved.png) - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.

1. Start by using the 07-Ins_Mern example as a base for your application.

2. Add code to connect to a MongoDB database named `googlebooks` using the mongoose npm package.

3. Using mongoose, then create a Book schema.

4. At a minimum, books should have each of the following fields:

* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

* `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

* Creating `documents` in your `books` collection similar to the following:

    ```js
    {
      authors: ["Suzanne Collins"]
      description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."

      link: "http://books.google.com/books?id=sazytgAACAAJ&dq=title:The+Hunger+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"
      title: "The Hunger Games"
    }
    ```

5. Create a layout similar to the mockups displayed above. This should be a SPA (Single Page Application) that uses [`react-router-dom`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) to navigate, hide and show your React components without changing the route within Express.

* The layout should include at least two React Components for each page `Search` and `Saved`.

* Feel free to try out alternative CSS framework to Bootstrap.

6. Add the following Express routes for your app:

* `/api/books` (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.

* `/api/books` (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.

* `/api/books/:id` (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo `_id`.

* `*` (get) - Will load your single HTML page in `client/build/index.html`. Make sure you have this _after_ all other routes are defined.

* Deploy your application to Heroku once complete. **You must use Create React App** and current versions of React and React-Router-Dom for this assignment.

## Hints
* Each section should be separated into individual components.
* It's best to add functions to App.js and pass it to the child components.
* If you want to load a background image you have to do it in the public folder.

### Available Scripts

* In the project directory, you can run:

 #### `npm start`

* Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

* The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

* Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

* Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

* The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

* See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
